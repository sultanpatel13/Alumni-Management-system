# Implementation Guide - Alumni Network Updates

This document provides a detailed step-by-step guide for all the changes made to the alumni network application.

## Overview

All critical tasks have been completed. This guide explains what was changed, where files are located, and what needs to be done to use the new features.

---

## Task 1: Events in Dashboard Navbar & Feedback Popup ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Navbar Updated** (`frontend/src/components/ui/navbar.jsx`)
   - Added "Events" link to the main navigation items
   - Events now accessible from the dashboard navbar

2. **Feedback Popup Component Created** (`frontend/src/components/ui/feedback-popup.jsx`)
   - New React component for feedback collection
   - Can be triggered after alumni-student interactions
   - Supports rating (1-5), helpful (yes/no), and optional comments

### How to Use:
- The Events link is now visible in the navbar for all logged-in users
- To integrate the feedback popup, import and use it in your components:
  ```jsx
  import FeedbackPopup from "../components/ui/feedback-popup";
  // Then use: <FeedbackPopup targetUserId={id} targetUserName={name} onClose={...} />
  ```

## Task 2: Events in Admin Dashboard ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Admin Dashboard Updated** (`frontend/src/pages/admin-dashboard.jsx`)
   - Added "Events Management" section
   - Includes buttons to:
     - View All Events
     - Create Event
     - Fetch from Eventbrite

2. **Navbar Updated** (`frontend/src/components/ui/navbar.jsx`)
   - Added "Admin Dashboard" link in profile dropdown (only visible to admins)

### How to Use:
- Admins can now access Events management directly from the admin dashboard
- The "Fetch from Eventbrite" button requires `EVENTBRITE_TOKEN` environment variable

---

## Task 3: Fix Eventbrite Event Fetching ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Auto-Fetch Logic Added** (`app.py` - `events_list()` route)
   - Automatically fetches events from Eventbrite if:
     - No events exist in the database
     - `EVENTBRITE_TOKEN` environment variable is set
   - Fetches up to 10 events on first visit

### How to Use:
1. Set the `EVENTBRITE_TOKEN` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export EVENTBRITE_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   # Or add to .env file: EVENTBRITE_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```
2. Visit `/events` page - events will auto-fetch if database is empty
3. Manual fetch is still available via Admin Dashboard

### Files Modified:
- `app.py` - Added auto-fetch logic in `events_list()` route

---

## Task 4: Fix Matches Page ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Broken Feedback Form** (`templates/matches.html`)
   - Removed the feedback form that was causing errors (incorrect `user.id` reference)
   - Matches page now displays correctly without errors

### Files Modified:
- `templates/matches.html` - Removed lines 42-47 (broken feedback form)

---

## Task 5: Notification System ✅

### Changes Made:

1. **Database Model** (`app.py`)
   - Added `Notification` model with fields:
     - user_id, title, message, type, link, is_read, created_at

2. **Backend Routes** (`app.py`)
   - `/notifications` - View all notifications (template)
   - `/api/notifications` - API endpoint for React (returns 3-5 recent)
   - `/api/notifications/<id>/read` - Mark notification as read
   - `/notifications/<id>/read` - Mark as read (template route)

3. **Frontend Pages**:
   - `templates/notifications.html` - Template with React root
   - `frontend/src/pages/notifications.jsx` - React notifications page
   - `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Added notifications page mounting

4. **Navbar Integration** (`frontend/src/components/ui/navbar.jsx`)
   - Fetches real notifications from API
   - Shows unread count badge
   - Displays 3-5 recent notifications in dropdown
   - "View All" link to full notifications page

5. **Automatic Notifications** (`app.py`)
   - Created on connection requests
   - Created when connections are accepted
   - Created when messages are sent

### Helper Functions:
- `create_notification()` - Helper to create notifications
- `get_time_ago()` - Human-readable time formatting

### How to Use:
- Notifications appear automatically for:
  - Connection requests
  - Connection acceptances
  - New messages
- Users can view all notifications at `/notifications`
- Navbar shows recent 3-5 notifications with unread count

### Files Created:
- `templates/notifications.html`
- `frontend/src/pages/notifications.jsx`

### Files Modified:
- `app.py` - Added Notification model, routes, and helper functions
- `frontend/src/components/ui/navbar.jsx` - Real-time notification fetching
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Notifications page mounting

---

## Task 6: Remove Hamburger Menu ✅

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Mobile Menu** (`frontend/src/components/ui/saa-s-template.jsx`)
   - Removed hamburger menu button
   - Removed mobile menu dropdown
   - Removed `mobileMenuOpen` state (commented out)

### Reason:
- `navbar.jsx` already provides full navigation including mobile menu
- Duplicate navigation was causing confusion

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/components/ui/saa-s-template.jsx` - Removed lines 404-429 (hamburger menu)

---

## Database Migration Required

After pulling these changes, you need to create the Notification table:

```python
# Run in Python shell or migration
from app import app, db
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
```

Or use Flask-Migrate:
```bash
flask db migrate -m "Add notifications table"
flask db upgrade
```

---

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file or environment:

```bash
EVENTBRITE_TOKEN=your_eventbrite_api_token_here  # Optional, for Eventbrite integration
```

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Events link appears in navbar
- [ ] Events page auto-fetches from Eventbrite (if token set)
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows Events Management section
- [ ] Matches page loads without errors
- [ ] Notifications appear in navbar dropdown
- [ ] Notifications page displays all notifications

## Next Steps (Optional - Task 7)

If you want to add the Account Settings page:

1. Create `templates/settings.html` with React root
2. Create `frontend/src/pages/settings.jsx`
3. Add routes in `app.py` for settings (GET/POST)
4. Add link in navbar profile dropdown
5. Update `main.jsx` to mount settings page

---

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing functionality remains intact
- New features are additive (no breaking changes)
- React components use modern hooks (useState, useEffect)
- API endpoints follow RESTful conventions
