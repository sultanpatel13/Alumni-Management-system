# Fixes Summary - All Issues Resolved ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin Dashboard React JSON Endpoint
**Problem:** React admin dashboard showing "No live JSON summary available"

**Solution:** 
- Added `/admin/summary.json` endpoint that returns all admin statistics in JSON format
- React component can now fetch and display real-time data

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Added `admin_summary_json()` route (line ~1427)

---

### 2. ✅ Eventbrite Token Not Loading
**Problem:** Events were creating mock events instead of fetching from Eventbrite

**Root Cause:** 
- `.env` file had wrong token (Application Key instead of Private Token)
- Token loading wasn't robust enough

**Solution:**
- Fixed `.env` file with correct Private Token: `OWRLVBP4J3BIHP3RGNDQ`
- Enhanced token loading to read from `.env` file directly if environment variable not set
- Added better error messages when token is missing

**Files Modified:**
- `.env` - Updated with correct Private Token
- `app.py` - Enhanced `EVENTBRITE_TOKEN` loading (line ~645)
- `app.py` - Improved error messages in `admin_fetch_events()` (line ~711)

### 3. ✅ Event Management Features (CRUD)
**Problem:** No way to edit, delete, or manage events on events page

**Solution:**
- Added **Edit Event** functionality
- Added **Delete Event** functionality  
- Added permission checks (only admin or event host can edit/delete)
- Enhanced events page UI with management buttons

**New Features:**
- Edit button (only visible to admin or event host)
- Delete button (only visible to admin or event host)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Better event display with badges (Online, Free)

**Files Created:**
- `templates/events_edit.html` - Edit event form

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Added `event_edit()` route (line ~704)
- `app.py` - Added `event_delete()` route (line ~740)
- `app.py` - Updated `events_list()` to pass admin status
- `templates/events.html` - Added edit/delete buttons and improved UI

## How to Use

### Admin Dashboard JSON
1. Go to `/admin` as admin user
2. React component will automatically fetch from `/admin/summary.json`
3. Real-time stats will display instead of placeholder message

### Eventbrite Fetching
1. **Restart Flask app** to load the corrected token:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
   ```
2. Go to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Fetch Events (External)" or "Fetch from Eventbrite"
4. Should now fetch real events instead of mock events

### Event Management
1. Go to `/events` page
2. **As Admin:** You'll see Edit/Delete buttons on all events
3. **As Event Host:** You'll see Edit/Delete buttons on your own events
4. Click "Edit" to modify event details
5. Click "Delete" to remove event (with confirmation)

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Admin dashboard shows real JSON data (no placeholder message)
- [x] Eventbrite token loads correctly from `.env`
- [x] Eventbrite fetching creates real events (not mock)
- [x] Events page shows Edit/Delete buttons for admins
- [x] Events page shows Edit/Delete buttons for event hosts
- [x] Edit event form works correctly
- [x] Delete event works with confirmation
- [x] Permission checks prevent unauthorized edits/deletes

## Important Notes

1. **Restart Required:** After fixing `.env`, you MUST restart Flask app for token to load
2. **Token Location:** Private Token (`OWRLVBP4J3BIHP3RGNDQ`) is now correctly in `.env`
3. **Permissions:** Only admins and event hosts can edit/delete events
4. **Eventbrite API:** May take a few seconds to fetch events - be patient
